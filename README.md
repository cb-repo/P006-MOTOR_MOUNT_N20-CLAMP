3. Push the motor into the clamp mount. This step may require a little more force than initially anticipating. While pressing the motor into place, ensure that the front face of the gearbox remains hard against the corresponsing internal wall.

4. Don't worry if the shaft is slightly not concentric in the cutout (as pictured below). When mounted this compresses down, holding the motor snugly in place and positioning the shaft correctly.
